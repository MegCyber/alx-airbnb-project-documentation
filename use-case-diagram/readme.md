## 🔗 System Interactions

### **Primary User Journeys**

#### **Guest Booking Journey**
```
Register Account → Login → Search Properties → View Property Details 
     ↓
Make Booking → Process Payment → Receive Confirmation → Write Review
```

#### **Host Property Management Journey**
```
Register Account → Login → Create Property → Upload Images 
     ↓
Manage Listings → Confirm Bookings → Respond to Reviews → Manage Payments
```

#### **Admin Oversight Journey**
```

```

### **Cross-Actor Interactions**
- **Guest ↔ Host**: Through booking confirmations and reviews
- **System ↔ Payment Gateway**: For all financial transactions
- **Admin ↔ All Users**: Through system monitoring and user management
- **System ↔ All Users**: Through automated notifications

## 🔄 Relationship Types

### **Association Relationships (Solid Lines)**
- Direct interaction between actor and use case
- Actor initiates the use case
- Most common relationship type in the diagram

**Examples:**
- Guest → Make Booking
- Host → Create Property
- Admin → Generate Reports

### **Include Relationships (Dashed Lines)**
- Mandatory functionality that's part of another use case
- Base use case always triggers the included use case
- Represents system dependencies

**Examples:**
- Make Booking includes Process Payment
- Create Property includes Upload Images
- Write Review includes Send Notifications

### **Extend Relationships (Dashed Lines with <<extend>>)**
- Optional functionality that may be added to a base use case
- Conditional execution based on specific circumstances

**Examples:**
- Login extends to Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled)
- Search Properties extends to Save Search (if user chooses)
- Make Booking extends to Apply Discount (if applicable)

### **Generalization/Inheritance**
- Specialized actors inherit capabilities from general actors
- Represented by arrows pointing to the general actor

**Examples:**
- Host inherits all Guest capabilities
- Premium Guest inherits standard Guest capabilities

## 💻 Implementation Notes

### **API Endpoint Mapping**
Each use case corresponds to specific API endpoints:

```python
# User Management
POST /api/v1/auth/register     # Register Account
POST /api/v1/auth/login        # Login/Authentication
PUT  /api/v1/users/profile     # Manage Profile

# Property Management  
GET  /api/v1/properties/search # Search Properties
GET  /api/v1/properties/{id}   # View Property Details
POST /api/v1/properties        # Create Property

# Booking Management
POST /api/v1/bookings          # Make Booking
GET  /api/v1/bookings          # View Bookings
PUT  /api/v1/bookings/{id}     # Cancel/Confirm Booking

# Payment Processing
POST /api/v1/payments          # Process Payment
GET  /api/v1/payments/history  # Manage Payments
POST /api/v1/payments/refund   # Process Refund
```

### **Database Entity Relationships**
Use cases map to database operations:
- **Register Account** → User table INSERT
- **Create Property** → Property table INSERT + Address relationships
- **Make Booking** → Booking table INSERT + validation queries
- **Process Payment** → Payment table INSERT + external API calls

### **Security Considerations**
- **Authentication Required**: All use cases except registration require valid JWT
- **Authorization Levels**: Role-based access control for different actor types
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization for all user-provided data
- **Audit Logging**: Track all significant user actions for security

### **Performance Implications**
- **High-Frequency Use Cases**: Search Properties, View Property Details
- **Resource-Intensive Operations**: Image uploads, payment processing
- **Caching Opportunities**: Property details, user profiles, search results
- **Async Processing**: Notifications, email sending, report generation
